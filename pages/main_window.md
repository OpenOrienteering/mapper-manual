This is the main window when drawing maps. By default it looks similar to this:

![ ](images/main_window.png)

The **toolbars** at the top provide access to the drawing tools, among others. See the [list of all toolbar elements](toolbars.md).

In the middle, the currently opened **map** is displayed.

On the right, a list of all **symbols** in the currently opened map file is shown. See [symbols](symbol_dock_widget.md).

On the bottom, there is the **status bar** which shows useful information about the usage of the currently active tool. Just by reading these tips, you can learn a lot about the drawing tools without reading this manual.

You can rearrange the position of the toolbars and the symbol pane as you wish by dragging them to the desired location.
