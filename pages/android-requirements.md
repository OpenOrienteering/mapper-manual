Android version
---------------

The minimum version for running the app is 2.3.


Water-proofing
--------------

For obvious reasons, water-proof devices may be advantageous.

Stylus
------

For doing any serious work, a stylus is a must-have (because of precision &
speed, and because of temperature during winter). You should preferably look
for devices which come with an adapted stylus such as the Samsung Galaxy Note
series, as general styluses for capacitive touch screens have rather wide tips.


Screen size
-----------

There is a compromise between ease of handling (better on smaller devices) and
overview (better on larger devices).


Battery
-------

It is very desirable to use a device with replaceable battery. It may be
possible to use an external battery pack for devices with integrated battery.


Sensors
-------

OpenOrienteering Mapper can use integrated GPS receivers. However, their
accuracy may be low, so it may be advantageous to connect to an external GPS
receiver. This can be done on the level of the Android Operating System (i.e.
not directly in the Mapper app), and instructions can be found on the internet. 
(E.g Bluetooth GPS app on

The app can use a magnetometer and accelerometer as a compass. Almost all modern
devices should contain these sensors. If a gyroscope is also available, it will
be used to improve the compass stability. However, these sensors are typically
not accurate enough to be used for measurements. They can be used for
convenience when not relying on a compass, but for accurate measurements, an
external compass is recommended.
